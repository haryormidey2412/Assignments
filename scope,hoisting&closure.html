    <h1>Scope</h1>
    <p>Scope: the extent of the area or subject matter that something deals with or to which it is relevant. 
        In JavaScript, that same definition is valid. Where you declare variables on your code will determine 
        how and from where you can access them.<br>There are two types of scope in JavaScript: Global and Local.<br>
        Global scope is declared outside of a block or function. With JavaScript, global scope when running 
        JavaScript on the browser is the “window”.<u>while</u>Local scope is declared outside of a block or function.
    </p><br>
    <h1>Hoisting</h1>
    <p>Hoisting means JavaScript moving variables or function declarations to the top of their context. This means 
        that in JavaScript, functions and variables can be accessed before they have been declared.
     </p>
     <h1>Closures</h1>
     <p>variables declared outside functions are global variables, and they can be accessed everywhere on the web page, 
        so, inside a function we can access variables declared in the global scope.<br>In addition, JavaScript allows 
        for functions inside functions (nested functions). When a function is defined within another function, the 
        inner function has access to the variable scope of the outer function. This is what function closures are.
