            <h1>JavaScript History</h1>

            <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.It was developed for Netscape 2, 
                and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, 
                the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser.<br>
                JavaScript is most widely used nowadays and most preferable language for development 
                as a front-end as well as back-end(Nodejs)
            </p>

            <p>The history is, Brendan Eich created Mocha which became LiveScript, and later JavaScript. 
                Netscape presented JavaScript to Ecma International, which develops standards and 
                it was renamed to ECMA-262 aka ECMAScript.
            </p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">ECMAscript</h2>

            <p>ECMAScript is a subset of JavaScript. JavaScript is basically ECMAScript at its core but builds upon it. 
                Languages such as ActionScript, JavaScript, JScript all use ECMAScript as its core.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px;"><b>ECMAScript as Standard:</b></h2>
            <li>
                ECMA-262: The Ecma International (a standards organization) has created the ECMA-262 standard<br>
                which is the official specification of the ECMAScript language.<br><br>
            </li><br><br>

            <li>
                Ecma Technical Committee 39 (TC39): is the group of people (Brendan Eich and others) who develop the ECMA-262 standard.
            </li><br><br>

            <li>
                ECMAScript 3 (December 1999). This is the version of ECMAScript that most browsers support today. 
                It introduced many features that have become an inherent part of the language for regular expressions, 
                better string handling, new control statements, try/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors,
                formatting for numeric output and other enhancements.
            </li><br><br>

            <li>
                ECMAScript 4 (July 2008). ECMAScript 4 was developed as the next version of JavaScript, with a prototype written in ML. 
                However, TC39 could not agree on its feature set. To prevent an impasse, the committee met at the end of July 2008 
                and came to an accord.
            </li><br><br>

            <li>
                ECMAScript 5 (December 2009). This version brings several enhancements to the standard library 
                and even updated language semantics via a strict mode. Currently browsers are supporting upto ES5 only.
            </li><br><br>

            <li>
                ECMAScript 6(2015):ES6 is an next-gen of JavaScript, the ecma technical committee 39 governs ecma 
                specification, they discovered new features to the javascript.ES6 can`t compile directly in browsers, 
                so need an compiler from ES6 to ES5, for that compiling using babel, it produce the browser compatible javascript.
            </li>
        </ul>
